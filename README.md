# Building-Footprint-Extraction

This repository is for the Python Elective course at the Faculty of ITC, University of Twente, Netherlands. The repository consists of the model and instructions required to perform building footprint extraction from satellite imagery using a U-Net model.

Due to no longer access available to the my older Google Drive, the data no longer exits unfortunately. Please refer to other open-source resources to download your own images. E.g., https://www.isprs.org/education/benchmarks/UrbanSemLab/default.aspx
